# MissionDemolition
Project 2 for SIUE CS 382.

Main Edits from book are as followed:
> The game over screen is implemented, it will show up once the player has completed the final level.
> There are 4 completely unique castles in order of (my personal) difficulty, starting off easy and getting harder with each castle.
> The rubber band has been added, when fired, it plays a rubber band plucking noise (Got from freesound.org. Credits to user tim.kahn at https://freesound.org/people/tim.kahn/sounds/148078/)
> On levels 3 and 4, there is a new type of wall, the metal wall. This wall is 4 times heavier than a regular wall and will take more effort to breach the defenses with them.
